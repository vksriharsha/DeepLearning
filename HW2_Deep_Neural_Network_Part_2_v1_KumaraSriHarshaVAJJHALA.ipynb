        "1. The default model is underfitting the data a little bit. From my experiments, I was able to achieve better test accuracy (78% with momentum in one case. The default model accuracy for momentum was around 73.5% in comparison) for a larger model. So, It was a high bias problem. But, once a sufficiently complex model is used, the model starts overfitting the data and the test accuracy drops. \n",
        "To handle the slight underfitting of data, we can try to increase the complexity of the model a bit. I have added more neurons on all layers and also tried adding a new layer. Unless the model is too complex, this fits the data well.\n",
        "But to handle the overfitting that results after increasing the complexity of the model a lot, we need to use techniques like early stopping, drop out, adding additional training data, regularization term etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. I have done 17 experiments by changing 7 different hyper parameters to first reduce the underfitting, then improve the generalization by using bigger minibatch sizes, smaller lambda and more neurons. I have also implemented an early stopping technique in the code above (Controlled by the variables early_stopping and val ) for controlling overfitting.  Below are the results of my experiments:\n",

        "3. On my best performing model, there were few false positives and false negatives. In the false positives, there were many dog-like animals like horses, cats, deers which is probably because of their similar snouts, color and other features. There were also some cars and aeroplanes which were falsely classified as dogs. This is probably due to noise in the image (possibly added?).The false negatives were dogs whose pictures were not clear, overexposed, small cat-like dogs and dogs not properly in the frame etc."
